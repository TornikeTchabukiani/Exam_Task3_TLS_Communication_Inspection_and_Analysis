----------------------------------

1. TLS Handshake Explanation
----------------------------
The TLS handshake is a multi-step process that establishes a secure communication
channel between the client (browser) and the server (website). The main steps are:

1. **Client Hello**
   - The client initiates the handshake, sending the list of supported TLS versions,
     cipher suites, and random data used to generate keys.

2. **Server Hello**
   - The server responds by selecting a TLS version and cipher suite from the list,
     and includes its own random data.

3. **Certificate Exchange**
   - The server sends its digital certificate, which includes its public key.
     The client uses the certificate to verify the server’s authenticity.

4. **Key Exchange**
   - Both sides derive a shared session key using methods such as ECDHE
     (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral), ensuring forward secrecy.

5. **Handshake Verification**
   - Both client and server send “Finished” messages encrypted with the new session key,
     confirming that the handshake was not altered.

6. **Secure Communication**
   - All subsequent data is encrypted and authenticated using symmetric encryption.

In Wireshark, the handshake can be seen in packets labeled:
   - “Client Hello”
   - “Server Hello”
   - “Certificate”
   - “Encrypted Handshake Message”


2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Protection
--------------------------------------
TLS protects against MITM attacks through several mechanisms:

- **Certificate Authentication:**  
  The client verifies the server’s certificate chain against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
  An attacker cannot forge a valid certificate without access to the CA’s private key.

- **Public Key Cryptography:**  
  The server’s private key is never transmitted. Even if a MITM intercepts the data,
  they cannot decrypt or impersonate the server without that private key.

- **Integrity Verification:**  
  Each message in the handshake and data transfer is verified using message authentication codes (MACs),
  ensuring no tampering occurs in transit.

- **Session Key Security:**  
  Session keys are generated per connection and discarded afterward.
  Even if one session is compromised, others remain secure.


3. TLS in HTTPS Communication
-----------------------------
When accessing a website via HTTPS (e.g., https://www.google.com), the browser and server use TLS
to ensure three main security properties:

- **Encryption:**  
  All communication between client and server is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping.

- **Authentication:**  
  The certificate system confirms the identity of the website.  
  The browser will warn users if the certificate is invalid or self-signed.

- **Integrity:**  
  Any modification of the transmitted data will be detected and rejected.

Example session details:
   - Protocol: TLSv1.3
   - Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   - Key Exchange: ECDHE (provides Perfect Forward Secrecy)
   - Authentication: RSA-2048
   - Certificate Issuer: Google Trust Services LLC

Thus, HTTPS with TLS provides a secure, authenticated, and confidential connection between users and websites.
